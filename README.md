# Simple Programme

A project template for [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) to generate programmes for simple conventions and conferences.

This template can be used to generate a single page web application for simple conventions and conference programmes that only have one or two parallel streams.

## Features

#### Static Web Page
The final product is a static web page, so can be hosted very cheaply on static file hosting sites such as [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

#### Offline
After being loaded once, the web application can be viewed offline without an internet connection.

#### Homescreen Application
The web application can be added to the homescreen on iOS, Andriod and Windows Phone.

#### Bookmark Programme Items
Users can bookmark programme items so they can see what is coming up that they would like to attend.

#### Updatable
The programme can be updated after people have loaded it, so long as they have an internet connection. It will remember what items they have bookmarked.

## Usage

1. [Install Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/)
2. `mkdir -p ~/.middleman`
3. `git clone git@github.com:aJanuary/simple-programme.git ~/.middleman/simple-programme`
2. `middleman init projectname --template=simple-programme`
3. Edit `data/programme.yaml`
4. `bundle exec middleman build`

The generated files will be in the `build` directory.

## `programme.yaml`

The `data/programme.yaml` file contains the data for the programme.

## Bookmark Storage

Bookmarks are stored as a cookie on the current domain. They also reflected in the fragment portion of the url. This is because iOS does not share cookies between a website and adding the website to the home screen. The fragment is used to communicate the bookmarks to the home screen version. Because the ids of bookmarked items are stored in the url, the `id` field should be kept short (ideally 2 or three characters) so the length of the URL does not exceed practical limits.
